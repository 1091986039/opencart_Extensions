category_keywords is a Extensions for category,It creates an area of hot keywords in left_column, which promotes SEO and extracts hot keywords from the category

## Version Requirements

opencart version 2.3.0.2 or below is recommended.

we used on opencart version 2.0.1.1,because it has modules,The latest version does not support this module because there is no Modules ,so We hope you can use it version 2.0.1.1

## How to use it?

- open Extension Installer,upload category_keywords.ocmod.zip(If you do not set up FTP, set FTP first)
